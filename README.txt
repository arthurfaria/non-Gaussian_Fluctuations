	- Non-Gaussian generalized Fokker-Planck (GenBM) equation (see 'gener_FP.pdf' file for further infos). Both the generalized semiclassical distriubtion (GenBM_rho) 
	and the distribution of a standard Brownian motion (BM_rho) are obatined considering a external harmonic potential. 
	Algorithm based on finite diference approach to compute derivatives.
