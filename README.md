## FT for EP and steady state using a combined Gaussian and non-Gaussian stochastic dynamics

This is a repository provides codes in `Python` to compute:
* The steady-state of generalized quantum master equation due to Gaussian + non-Gaussian noises: overdamped DLD model [1].
* The fluctuation theorem for the Entropy production of a Brownian particle subject to a Gaussian and Poisson noises [2].
