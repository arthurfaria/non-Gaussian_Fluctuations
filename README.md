# Generalized master equation:

This is a repository provides codes in `Python` to compute:
* The steady-state of generalized quantum master equation due to Gaussian + non-Gaussian noises: overdamped DLD model [1]
* Entropy production for a Brownian particle subject to a Gaussian and Poisson noises.
